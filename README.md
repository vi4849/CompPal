# InspectYour Gadget

Welcome to InspectYour Gadget, a digital platform designed to demystify the process of finding the laptop that best suits your preferences and lifestyle. Hosted on a user-friendly website, our product features a short survey that allows users to consider and rank their priorities in selecting a laptop to purchase. Based on the survey responses and product data fetched from popular tech seller sites like BestBuy, our backend processes use the OneHotEncoder and K-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithms to identify the top 3 product listings that will give the user what they are looking for in a laptop.
